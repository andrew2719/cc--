a) Greedy Algorithm:

Sort the people in increasing order of their crossing times.
Take the first two people """(the ones with the smallest crossing times) and send them across the bridge.
The faster person returns with the flashlight.
Repeat steps 2-3 with the next two people until everyone has crossed the bridge.
For the given problem, the algorithm works as follows:

Sort the people in increasing order of their crossing times: Person 1 takes 1 minute, Person 2 takes 2 minutes, Person 3 takes 5 minutes, and Person 4 takes 10 minutes.
Send Person 1 and Person 2 across the bridge, which takes 2 minutes.
Person 1 returns with the flashlight, which takes 1 minute.
Send Person 3 and Person 4 across the bridge, which takes 10 minutes.
Person 2 returns with the flashlight, which takes 2 minutes.
Send Person 1 and Person 2 across the bridge, which takes 2 minutes.
Total time taken: 2+1+10+2+2=17 minutes.

b) No, the algorithm does not necessarily yield a minimum crossing time for every instance of the problem.

c) To prove that the algorithm yields a minimum crossing time when there are only two people, we can use a proof by contradiction. Suppose that there exists a faster way to cross the bridge. Since there are only two people, one person must cross the bridge twice, and the other person must cross the bridge once. Without loss of generality, let's assume that Person 1 crosses the bridge twice, and Person 2 crosses the bridge once. Then the total crossing time would be:

t = 2t1 + t2

where t1 is the time it takes for Person 1 to cross the bridge, and t2 is the time it takes for Person 2 to cross the bridge.

However, if we follow the greedy algorithm, the total crossing time would be:

t' = max(t1, t2) + min(t1, t2) = t2 + t1

Since t' = t, the greedy algorithm yields a minimum crossing time when there are only two people.

d) For n = 4, the greedy algorithm does not yield a minimum crossing time. A counterexample is when the crossing times are as follows: Person 1 takes 1 minute, Person 2 takes 2 minutes, Person 3 takes 3 minutes, and Person 4 takes 6 minutes. In this case, the greedy algorithm would take 1+2+3+6+2+1=15 minutes to cross the bridge, but a faster way to cross the bridge would be to send Person 1 and Person 2 across the bridge, then Person 1 returns with the flashlight (total time: 2 minutes), then send Person 3 and Person 4 across the bridge, and finally Person 2 returns with the flashlight (total time: 11 minutes).

e) The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The crossing time is proportional to the sum of the crossing times of each pair, which is at most twice the sum of all crossing times, i.e., O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).
